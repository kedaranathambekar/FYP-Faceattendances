### Academic Title
y
Innovative Face Recognition Technology for Attendance Systems


### Description about project:

The goal of my project is to enable face attendance. The idea's motivation is the quick development of technology, which allows us to continuously find new ways to improve the quality of our lives. This facial recognition technology is significant because it can recognize faces fast, capture them, and enter them into the attendance database. At the end of each day, the technology will automatically scan faces and produce an accurate employee report. In terms of health, it encourages security, order, and personal hygiene.
The fundamental idea behind the entire project is this: whenever a new employee joins the team, they submit a photo, which gets stored in the database. When an employee walks into the workplace and stands in front of the camera, the system detects and records their face, saving the details on the record page, as well as the time
